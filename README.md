# the 6-Jars System

in progress

## General

Saved is one of the basic elements of money management. Systematically putting aside the sum (or%) of the salary, other users that to save you need to start earning some extra money.

One of the recently popular methods that allow you to have financial resources is the system of 6 jars developed by businessman, writer, motivator and speaker - T. Harva Eker. What is it about and why is it worth implementing this method in everyday life?

Eker believes that this is the most effective and at the same time the most effective way to manage money, no matter what monthly amount we have and how much money we have in the home budget.

The Eker system is based on the monthly division of the received revenue into six parts. Of course, you can spread the funds into the title "six jars", but it may be more convenient to deposit money on six bank sub-accounts.

Particular attention should be paid so that the distributed money does not mix with each other under any circumstances. So they cannot be on a shared account or in one proverbial "jar".

However, the individual parts of the funds collected should not be equal. The right percentage distribution is important here. Each jar corresponds to different, everyday life needs.
